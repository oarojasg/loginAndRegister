# Motivation

The register and login pages are part of any web application requiring user authentication. Yet there are not available templates on the Internet using specific frameworks like React.js.

This is an attempt to provide an easy-to-use template for MVPs with no encrypting, using an SPA developed in React.js for an ASP.NET Identity WebApi.

# The problem to solve

Basically, this project aims to speed up the time-to-delivery in MVPs, prototypes and proof of concepts. While you concentrate on the core business idea there is a template that you can use to integrate to your project, thus skippping the authentication frontend task.

# What did I learn?

The flexibility of the framework encouraged me to sort the different functionalities of the web pages in reusable components that follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

In addition, React.js is currently one of the most commonly used frontend frameworks. Although I have not had work experience with React, this project allowed me to develop my frontend skills.

# What would make this project stand out

There is a wide variety of implementations using other frameworks. However, an SPA targeted for the ASP.NET Identity WebApi can complement the interoperability between these two libraries for those using them in their projects.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
