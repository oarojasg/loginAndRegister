# Login And Register

This is a simple SPA for the ASP.NET Identity WebApi. It is intended to provide a fast solution with no encryption for developing MVPs.

This SPA uses the Identity endpoints /login and /register, managing the session through the custom .NET token.

The project was developed in React.js. The flexibility of the framework encouraged me to sort the different functionalities of the web pages in reusable components that follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

In addition, React.js is currently one of the most commonly used frontend frameworks. Although I have not had work experience with React, this project allowed me to develop my frontend skills.

## Motivation

The register and login pages are part of any web application requiring user authentication. Yet there are not available templates on the Internet using specific frameworks like React.js.

## The problem to solve

Basically, this project aims to speed up the time-to-delivery in MVPs, prototypes and proof of concepts. While you concentrate on the core business idea there is a template that you can use to integrate to your project, thus skippping the authentication frontend task.

## What would make this project stand out?

There is a wide variety of implementations using other frameworks. However, an SPA targeted for the Identity WebApi can complement the interoperability for those using both React.js and .NET in their projects.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
